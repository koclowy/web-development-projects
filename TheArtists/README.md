# 🎵 TheArtists – Full-Stack Music Streaming Web Application

**TheArtists** is a full-stack music streaming web application inspired by modern platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.  
It allows users to discover artists, browse songs, manage playlists, track points, and enjoy a personalized music experience.

This project was built as part of my Web Application Programming module, focusing on both frontend and backend development.
